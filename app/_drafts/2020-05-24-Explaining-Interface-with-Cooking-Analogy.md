title: Explaining an Interface with a Cooking Analogy

Gather round, young grasshoppers. You'll hear about an Interface in your coding
education. Sometimes it sounds confusing. Even
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)) says it's 


I love to cook, but I rarely follow a single recipe. If, suppose, I want to make
a chicken and rice dish, a
[web search](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=chicken+and+rice+recipes&t=ffab&ia=recipes)
reveals about a metric million chicken and rice recipes. Some of the recipes require
an instant pot, some want a cast iron skillet, and some need a crockpot. Regardless
of what tools they need, they still make chicken and rice.

So why am I writing this on my new coding blog? Recipes are like interfaces. The meal
you make is the concrete instantiation of the interface. The specific hardware
required for the recipe is like your coding language. You can use the recipe to
make a meal, exactly as you take an interface to make your object instance.

If you don't have an instant pot, no matter how hard you try, you won't be able
to follow an instant pot recipe. If you don't code in ruby, you won't be able to
use a ruby interface. You can still take the recipe and modify it for the tools
you have, but it won't be the same.

You can easily take the recipe and adjust some ingredients to fit your specific
needs, if you have dietary restrictions, or just don't like the lima beans that
grandma put in her otherwise famous dish. That might be like removing portions
of code that have been deprecated by the sands of time, or portions of jQuery
that deal with IE6.

Following a recipe to the letter is like assuming that your implementation works
correctly. One thing you'll always hear Chef Gordon Ramsey yelling out to home
chefs is to "taste it." You're testing that it does what it is supposed to do.
By tasting it, you can adjust the seasonings, or find some place where the result
of a calculation should be 1.33382, but your code returns it as 1.33381. By testing,
you can produce a better product.

On the other hand, when I cook, I'll often take a shortcut. When I make chicken
pot pie, I will purchase premade pastry shells. I haven't made mashed potatoes
from raw tubers in years; I opt for the box (or pouch). Some cooking puritans
might call that cheating, but when was the last time you coded something without
using a composer or npm package, or a ruby gem? These products exist to make it
easier on us. You could make a hollandaise sauce from scratch, and fine tune it
to suit the specific needs of the client, or stomach. Or, you could use a packet
of powdered hollandaize because it works. It might not be the best, but it works.
If you need the best, or need to extend a package to fit your latest project,
you're extending your technique.

I didn't sit down to day to write this, I was actually going to start writing
down some of my recipes so I could look back in 5 years and remember a dish I
haven't made in a while. Maybe tomorrow. It will give me a reason to keep this
blog cooking.

Being my first generally creative work in a while, please forgive the jankiness
of the written word flow; I'm generally better in person, where I can judge and
react to your body language. If we were in person, I could tell or ask directly
if I have too many examples, or if it needs more specificity.
