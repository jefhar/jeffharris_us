## Overview
"**Mass Effect** is a third-person shooter, action role-playing video game series
developed by BioWare," according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect).

When starting a playthrough, the gamer chooses his or her own Shepard. This
project gives random choices to the selections that the player needs to make
at the beginning of the game.

This SPA pulls JSON data from a public Shepard API and displays the information
for the player to use to create a character at the beginning of a game. It does
not suggest any of the game play options or a specific path through the game.
