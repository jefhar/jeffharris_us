        This allows a business to keep track of consignment inventory as it enters the warehouse and sales. The
        github repo is a delayed mirror of the latest master branch with a few files anonymized to protect the warehouse.

    - name: Mass Effect Shepard Generator (POP)
      description: Mass Effect, the 2007 Bioware video game, starts by asking the player to create his or her own character.
        <br>
        Sometimes, a player just needs random choices. This page pulls an data from an API and creates a page
        with the random choices for the user to enter.
        <br>
        The API is vanilla PHP, built in the /api-src
        folder. On each push to the Master git branch, GitLab's CI/CD runner pushes a copy of the repository
        to the API server, refreshes composer dependencies and updates the `document_root` directory for
        zero-downtime deployment.

                     players shoot by placing a hand with extended fingers into the middle. The fingers are added, and if
