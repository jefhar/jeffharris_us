      description: <em>Hangman</em> is the simple find a word game played by children with pencil and paper the world over. Is it the best? Probably not. Is the the fastest? Probably not. However, I built it and it works.
        This uses the `/usr/share/dict/american-english` word file from Ubuntu 19.04.
        The proper nouns and words with non-letter characters have been removed.

        <br>
        Sometimes, a player just needs random choices. This page pulls an data from an API and creates a page
        with the random choices for the user to enter.
        <br>
        The API is vanilla PHP, built in the /api-src
        folder. On each push to the Master git branch, GitLab's CI/CD runner pushes a copy of the repository
        to the API server, refreshes composer dependencies and updates the `document_root` directory for
        zero-downtime deployment.

    - name: Odds or Evens
      description: <em>Odds Or Evens</em> is a simple game played by two people. One chooses "Odds" or "Evens," then both
                     players shoot by placing a hand with extended fingers into the middle. The fingers are added, and if
                     the sum is odd, the "Odds" player wins. Otherwise, the "Evens" player wins.
