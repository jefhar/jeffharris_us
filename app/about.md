I've had a few projects hanging around, but nothing worth tooting my own horn
about it (I'm still not sure I have anything to toot about). I have eventually
come to the realization, that I do know more than I think. Maybe I'm just having
trouble remembering it, because of everything else I'm learning.

The first time I was in school, we used flash cards to write things down so we
could do drills and check that what we were learning was actually entering our
memory. So because of that, I've started writing down the things I keep looking
at so I know where they are. And now they're here. The `Code Snippets`
category is a collection of my digital flash cards. As long as I remember to
keep adding snippets when I need them.

I am a re-entry student attending Southern New Hampshire University, pursuing a
Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with an emphasis in Software Engineering.

Currently on pause while finding new employment; six terms remaining.
